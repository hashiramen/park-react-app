1. Clone the project
2. Change **google maps API key** in **index.html** to your own: 'https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=**your_key_right_here**'
3. Run **"npm install"** to install dependencies
4. Then you can use **npm run start** to launch local server and open the project at [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)

Hope you like it, it was a really fun project to work with.
And hopefully I did what I was suppose to :D
